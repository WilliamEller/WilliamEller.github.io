                <p>Hello, hopefully if you are seeing this you are in the right place and you were actually looking for me.</p>
                <p>This will be what i want to do in game dev</p>
                <p>I am currently in my last year of college. I am attending Neumont College of Computer Science, I'm in the Bachelor of Science in Software and Game Development Degree. During this program I learned things like Game Design, Level Design, and Scripting said levels. </p>
                <p>This will be a segway into the next section</p>
                <p>During Neumont I did a lot of projects to demonstrate I was actually learning things in my classes. Below is a some of the projects I enjoyed working on. If you click on the entry it will take you to a page dedicated to the project, there you will find more info on the projects, and be able to play some of them.</p>

                <a href="spring.html">
                    <p>This game was made for a school hosted Game jam. I had from Friday to Monday to make something based on Spring, whether it was springs as a mechanic or Spring like the season. This game is a puzzle game with a couple of different puzzles that the player has to go look for and find.</p>

                <a href="capstone.html">
                    <p>This was my capstone project. To start the final year of Neumont College you must pass a capstone project. Like most colleges I'm sure they also have capstones where they are supposed to use everything they learned to pass it, this is the same thing but we only have 10 weeks to complete our projects.</p>
