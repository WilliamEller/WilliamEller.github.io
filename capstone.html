                        <p>Since this game isn't playable easily i have more screenshots of this game compared to the others.</p>

                        <p>This is the ship select screen, its very simple it was thrown in very last minute but it works so I'm not complaining.</p>

                        <p>The game is a simple 2D arcade kind of shooter. The game can be played with two players on keyboard or comfortably with a solo with a controller.</p>

                        <img class="image" src="Images/PrismaGame2.PNG"/>
                        <p>This is the main mechanic of the game. The ships can join together to make a bigger ship. This lead to the game becoming very complex because every ship needed a combo weapon with every other ship.</p>
