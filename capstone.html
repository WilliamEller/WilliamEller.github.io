                        <p>Since this game isn't playable easily i have more screenshots of this game compared to the others.</p>

                        <p>This is the ship select screen, its very simple it was thrown in very last minute but it works so I'm not complaining.</p>

                        <p>The game is a simple 2D arcade kind of shooter. The game can be played with two players on keyboard or comfortably with a solo with a controller.</p>

                        <p>This is the main mechanic of the game. The ships can join together to make a bigger ship. This lead to the game becoming very complex because every ship needed a combo weapon with every other ship.</p>

                <h2>Game Thoughts</h2>
                <p>This will be stuff that i thought while making the video game</p>
                <p>Prisma Wings was really hard to make. For the main focus of this project I wanted to spend more time learning the new game engine Lumberyard and the Scripting language Lua. I had to make a presentable game though and it was a pretty good application of what I was learning in the Lumberyard Engine. The idea behind the game was to eventually make the multiplayer and have multiple players flying around and so it would be this experience of combining the different weapons. I tried to focus on making the weapons feel good to use and I think I did well.</p>
                <p>This game was made for my Capstone project and one of the things our capstone was graded on was technical breath vs depth. I wanted to do a project that covered both of those topics and so I chose a relatively simple game idea and a new technology.</p>
                <!-- <p>The game was one of my first like on my own kind of projects and I was in charge of pacing myself and the work that I did. I didn't make as much progress as I wanted to because I got very depressed in the middle of the project so I had to crunch just to get something presentable.</p> -->
