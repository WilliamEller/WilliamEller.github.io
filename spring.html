                <h2>The Thought Behind The Game</h2>
                <p>The game was made for a spring themed game jam. whenever I think of Spring i think of the cherry blossom trees and how pretty they look when they lose their leaves. I wanted the mechanics of the game to be simple so I could focus on Level Design. The controls are simple and the puzzles are easy but I wanted to try and tell a story without words, (I ended up using some words at the end but fore the most part no actual guidance is given to the player).</p>
