                <!-- <p>There is gonna be a big image of me somewhere on this page and then like a wall of text about the things that i like and what i wanna do with making video games. I'll probably talk about my love of soccer and running in general, i might talk about things like halo and pokemon during whatever happens here and maybe find a nicer way to describe the mess of a person i am along with other personality things</p> -->
                <p>Hello, I really want to be a game designer. Like I said on my home page, I'm in my senior year of college, where I am studying in the Bachelor of Science in Software and Game Development degree. I'll be graduating in August of 2019.</p>
                <p>I have the most experience with C#, it is my most prefered coding language, but I am also capable with Lua, Javascript, Lua and C++. I also love using Unity, but I have an understanding of Unreal 4 and have the basics of Lumberyard, so I'm pretty confident in whatever engine I'm asked to use. Although I have all of that information written everywhere how about stuff about me as a person.</p>
                <p>I like to think I'm interesting. Some of my favorite things include running, whether its for soccer or any other sport or just jogging or hiking. I also play a lot of video games, Halo is the top of my list but things like Pokemon and Super Smash Bros are also apart of my heavy rotation, but I like most genres of video games, like recently I've been playing Final Fantasy 14. If people care enough to ask whether I'm an Introvert or Extrovert and I always say both, because I love reading or sitting alone listening to music, but I also love being the center of attention at like a party or weekly DnD.</p>
                <!-- <p>I might even get fancy and add extra paragraphs so it might end up looking something like this. I will probably just like break all those previous points into there own paragraphs so this page looks longer.</p> -->
