                <p>There is gonna be a big image of me somewhere on this page and then like a wall of text about the things that i like and what i wanna do with making video games. I'll probably talk about my love of soccer and running in general, i might talk about things like halo and pokemon during whatever happens here and maybe find a nicer way to describe the mess of a person i am along with other personality things</p>
                <p>I might even get fancy and add extra paragraphs so it might end up looking something like this. I will probably just like break all those previous points into there own paragraphs so this page looks longer.</p>
